# Invisible man

This is a unit-testing framework, designed to interact with any number
of remote hosts by sending them commands at specified intervals. This
framework is intended to be transparent to the hosts, acting as an
"invisible ... man."

## Documentation

Extensive documentatin is included inside the source files, which I
may one day transfer here should I find the time. Also included are
sample files to feed into the invisible man.

## Getting started

Open up the file `shell.pl` to begin your journey browsing code. Once
you're ready to give it a shot, look at the documentation and
examples for the end users, located in `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
